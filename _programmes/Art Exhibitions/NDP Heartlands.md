<p>What a day to remember! The National Day Heartland Celebrations 2025 @
North East was a lively, joy-filled event as families and friends came
together to celebrate Singapore’s 60th birthday.</p>

<p>At the Shaping Hearts booth, visitors stopped by to admire a heartfelt
collection of SG60-themed artworks created by talented artists with disabilities,
each piece sharing a unique story of pride, hope, and community spirit.</p>

<p>Families joined in the fun by taking part in fringe activities like colouring
masks, and those who donated or spent $5 and above at the Shaping Hearts
booth received a recycled plastic bottle to decorate and light up the “Hope”
structure with fairy lights.</p>

<p>As more bottles were added, the structure sparkled brighter — a beautiful,
shared symbol of a collective wish for a kinder and more inclusive Singapore.</p>

<p>The futuristic photo wall also drew plenty of attention, with people snapping
fun, colourful photos and capturing memories of a special day.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who dropped by, supported our artists, and helped
make the celebration so meaningful. Here's to 60 years of Singapore — and
many more, shaped by hearts that care.</p>
