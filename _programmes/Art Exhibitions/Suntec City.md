Suntec City with a vibrant exhibition that took visitors on a nostalgic
journey back to 1940s Singapore.</p>

<p>Families enjoyed hands-on fringe activities, including mask and origami
colouring, adding an extra splash of creativity and fun to the experience.
It was heartwarming to see children and parents alike getting involved
and expressing themselves through art.</p>
