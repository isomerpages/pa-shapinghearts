with disabilities, inviting visitors to experience their creativity, stories,
and perspectives in a unique public setting.</p>

<p>Live performances throughout the event lit up the atmosphere with music,
movement, and heart. From the uplifting rhythms of ParaBeatz and Azalea
Band (Faith Music Centre) to evocative performances by ART:DIS artists
and moving solos, each act was a beautiful reminder of the power of creative
expression.</p>
