## About MINDS Satellite Hub (Bukit Batok)

![](https://i.ibb.co/dwjT1zKZ/MINDS-Satellite-Hub-Bukit-Batok.jpg)

MINDS Hubs are physical one-stop touchpoints located in the heartlands of Singapore, designed for Persons with Intellectual Disability (PWIDs) and their caregivers to access more targeted disability-specialized programmes and services. A large majority of PWIDs today may be undiagnosed, unserved, or not receiving regular services. Through the set-up of MINDS Hubs, they hope to reach out to and encourage these groups to join their support network, where they can assess needs and bridge them to resources/services.
