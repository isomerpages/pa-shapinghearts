THK Homes for Disabled cater to individuals with intellectual disabilities, addressing various needs and circumstances. 

Since its inception in 1989, the THK Home for Disabled @ Eunos has evolved from providing residential care for children with intellectual disabilities to offering long-term residential care for adults. The expansion includes individuals with high levels of community skills who do not require institutional care.
 
THK Home for Disabled Adults @ Sembawang, founded in April 2018, extends its services to adults aged 17 to 55 diagnosed with intellectual disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and other co-morbidities. Additionally, it provides short-term respite care services and crisis placements for those classified under the Vulnerable Adults category by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).
