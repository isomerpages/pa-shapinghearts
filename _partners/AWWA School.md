<p>Started in 1979, AWWA School provides special education to children with
multiple disabilities and children with Autism, aged 7 to 18, to maximise
the potential for independence and improve quality of life of students
with special needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than a structured academic and non-academic curriculum and CCA programme,
the school constantly explores collaboration opportunities with stakeholders
to expose our students to different platforms in the community that they
could participate in and have richer learning experiences. This enables
students to develop, as well as generalize and adapt the skills they have
learnt. </p>
