<p>Started in 1979, AWWA School provides special education to children with
multiple disabilities and autism, aged 7 to 18, to maximise the potential
for independence and improve their quality of life. Other than a structured
academic and non-academic curriculum along with CCA programme, the school
constantly explores collaboration opportunities with stakeholders to expose
students to different platforms in the community they could participate
in and gain richer learning experiences. This enables them to develop,
as well as generalise and adapt the skills they have learnt.&nbsp;</p>
