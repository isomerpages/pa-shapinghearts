Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore (CPAS) is a social service agency providing care and services for children and adults with Cerebral Palsy (CP) or multiple disabilities. Formerly known as the Spastic Children's Association of Singapore, CPAS was founded in 1957 and provides early intervention, special education, therapy rehabilitation and clinics, day activity centre programmes, vocational training, and sheltered employment for over 700 children and adults.Â 


At CPAS Goodwill, Rehabilitation & Occupational Workshop, trainees not only have the opportunity to pick up vocational training skills but also earn a monthly allowance through performing simple re-work assignments such as sorting, packing, assembly, labelling, as well as through sales of their paintings, crafts, and printed artwork merchandise.
