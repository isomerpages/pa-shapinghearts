<p>The Handicaps Welfare Association (HWA), founded in 1969 by a group of
23 individuals, is an organization run by people with disabilities for
people with disabilities in Singapore. Originally registered as the Singapore
Handicaps Friendship Club, it became the Singapore Association for the
Disabled in 1975 and adopted its current name in 1976.</p>
<p>HWA is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for people with physical
disabilities, integrating them into mainstream society, and advocating
for their welfare, education, and employment. The association also raises
awareness about the needs of people with disabilities and works to secure
necessary benefits and support for its members.</p>
