## About Christian Outreach To The Handicapped

![](https://i.ibb.co/0p6MXPTW/christian-outreach.jpg)

Christian Outreach to the Handicapped (COH), founded in 1979 is dedicated to empowering adults with disabilities (aged 18-55) to live independent and fulfilling lives. Their mission is to provide a supportive and inclusive environment that advocates for their rights and promotes personal growth.

COH offers a variety of programmes: including therapy, daily living support and caregiver assistance. All programmes are designed to enhance physical, emotional and cognitive well-being of our beneficiaries. They also provide resources and activities to help caregivers maintain their well-being while supporting those in their care.

Serving individuals and families from all backgrounds, COH strives to be a trusted and transformative source of support for those in need.
