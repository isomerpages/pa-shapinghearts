<p>Arts@Metta was initiated in 2007 by Metta Welfare Association to actively
seek to increase employment opportunities for graduated Metta School Youths
diagnosed with mild disability and/or autism through a comprehensive training
and development in the visual arts. They strive to empower them with life
skills that promote integration, independence and socialisation.</p>
