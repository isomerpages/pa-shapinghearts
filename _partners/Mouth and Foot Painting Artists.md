## About Mouth and Foot Painting Artists

![](https://i.ibb.co/gL1Xd3X1/Mouth-and-Foot-Painting-Artists.jpg)

MFPA is an international association wholly owned and run by disabled artists to help them meet their financial needs. Members paint with brushes held in their mouths or feet as a result of a disability sustained at birth or through an accident or illness that prohibits them from using their hands.
