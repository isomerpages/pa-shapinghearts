<p>Friends of the Disabled Society (FDS) is a Social Service Agency that
aims to meet the physical, social and emotional needs of the disabled through
their Social Interaction Program, Home Visitation Program and the Skills
and Entrepreneurship Program. Their Social Interaction Program aims to
meet their social needs by providing avenues for them to interact among
themselves and with able-bodied persons. The Home Visitation Program serves
those who are severely disabled and homebound. The Skills and Entrepreneurship
Program encourages independence by providing them with job opportunities.</p>
