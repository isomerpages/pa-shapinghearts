<p>St. Andrewâ€™s Autism school is part of the St Andrew's Autism Centre (SAAC).
SAAC was established in 2005 to meet a growing need to serve individuals
on the Autism Spectrum. Their vision is to enable persons with Autism to
lead dignified and meaningful lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They achieve this by enriching their lives and that of their families
through quality education, training and care, distinguished by Christian
love and compassion.</p>
