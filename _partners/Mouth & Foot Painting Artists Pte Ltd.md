<p>Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (MFPA) is an international association
wholly owned and run by disabled artists to help them meet their financial
needs. Members paint with brushes held in their mouths or feet as a result
of a disability sustained at birth or through an accident or illness that
prohibits them from using their hands.</p>
