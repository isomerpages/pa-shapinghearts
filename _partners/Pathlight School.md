<p>Pathlight School is the first autism-focused school in Singapore to offer
the national curriculum together with life readiness skills. It caters
to students on the autism spectrum with related conditions, aged 7 to 18
years, who are cognitively able to access national curriculum but require
additional support such as smaller class sizes, special accommodations
and teaching staff trained in autism.</p>
<p>The School was established by Autism Resource Centre (Singapore) at the
invitation of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and started operations in
January 2004 with just 41 students. Today, it has more than 2,030 students
and is one of the fastest growing and progressive special schools in Singapore.</p>
